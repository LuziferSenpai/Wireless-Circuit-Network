# Wireless-Circuit-Network

Hey Guys,

this modification adds two new entities to the game. First the `Wireless transmitter`, that transmits all signals from the connected wires to the reciever in his network. Second the `Wireless reciever` that is like I said before, recieving all signals from the transmitter on the network. If signals are send multiple times the count gets added up.

I have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/rVpjuh4) for discussion, etc.

##Networks can be created or deleted via a GUI. You can open the GUI when you click on the button in the top left corner. (Circuit Network Tech Icon)

##You can change the update ratio in settings! Minimum 1 tick, maximum 300 ticks. 1 sec = 60 ticks.

##If you copy/paste the entity settings you can copy/paste the network which is used.
