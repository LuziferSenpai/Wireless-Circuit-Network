# Wireless-Circuit-Network

Hey Guys,

this Modification adds two new Entitys to the Game. First the Wireless Sender, that sends ALL Signal from the connected Wires to the Reciever in his Network. Second the Reciever that is like I said before, recieving ALL Signals from the Wires. If Signals are send multiple times the Count gets added up.

#INFO!!!
If you used the old Version, dont just update! You need to remove the MOD from the Savefile, because I changed the hole Entity Registration!

##Networks can be created or deleted via a GUI. You can open the GUI when you click on the Button in the Top Left Corner. ( Circuit Network Tech Icon )

##You can change the Update Ratio in Settings! Minimum 1 Tick, Maxium 300 Ticks. 1 Sec = 60 Ticks.

##If you copy/paste the entity Settings you can copy/paste the Network which is used.

##Planned Changes
	- New Graphics
